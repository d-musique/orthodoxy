# Orthodoxy

Orthodoxy is a tool for programmers who believe that C++ needs *less*,
not *more*.

Feedback is appreciated.**

## Introduction

Orthodoxy is a plugin for the Clang compiler, which selectively
disables specific features of the C++ language. This way, a programmer
can configure their own custom subset of the C++ language which is
tailored to a particular project.

## Basic usage

Create a configuration file in the project directory, and compile the
code with `orthodox-clang++`.

Under CMake, `orthodoxy` is easy to use. The following code will
enable it for all subsequent targets.

> CMakeLists.txt
>
> ```
> find_package(orthodoxy CONFIG OPTIONAL_COMPONENTS plugin)
> if(orthodoxy_plugin_FOUND)
>   link_libraries(orthodoxy::plugin)
> endif()
> ```

See [Reference](#reference) for available rules, and the `test` folder
for a set of minimal examples.

> .orthodoxy.yml
>
> ```yaml
> ---
> Class: false
> NonPOD: false
> Constructor: false
> Destructor: false
> Inheritance: false
> Access: false
> ImplicitThis: false
> NamedCast: false
> OperatorOverload: false
> ConversionOverload: false
> Reference: false
> Exception: false
> RangeBasedLoop: false
> Lambda: false
> New: false
> Auto: false
> DefaultArgument: false
> ```

If present in source code, any use of a disabled language features
will raise a compilation error. One can suppress such errors on an
individual basis by writing a comment on the same line as the element
which raises the error.

## Installation

This compiler plugin tightly integrates with a particular version of
the Clang compiler, so you have to compile a version that matches your
installed compiler.

```sh
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo
cmake --build build
sudo cmake --build build --target install
```

**TODO: Help needed to write Windows-specific instructions and
helper scripts.**

## Motivation

C++ is often considered a very complicated language, while C is very
simplistic, and there exists no language in between to fill the gap.
As C++ adds features and grows its standard library, complication
worsens and compilation speed degrades.

Many developers limit themselves to more of less strict, vaguely
defined subsets of C++. One such subset is known as Orthodox C++.

Orthodoxy is named after Orthodox C++ and its goal is to easily
remodel C++ into a simpler, *better C* language according to the needs of
a specific project.
